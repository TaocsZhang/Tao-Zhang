More about myself

I am obsessed with data-driven AI, and my passion is to use AI for good and use AI for helping humanity. AI-based innovations are powering some of the most cutting-edge solutions we use in our daily lives. We enjoy the convenience that AI brings to us, and meanwhile, we feel lost and isolated by this high-tech. 

Currently, I am doing my Ph.D. studies in the third year with the school of Computer Science at UTS. My research topic is AI Ethics, especially in designing fair and secure AI. During my studies, I have published more than 10 academic papers, including some high-ranking journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Industry Informatics. 

Meanwhile, I am doing an internship in Datarwe as a Data Scientist. Datarwe is a company aiming on developed innovative medical solutions based on cloud-based AI. I am working a project that utilizes AWS to create a platform as a service solution for hospitals to predict septic shock in advance. My work includes:  pre-processed real-world datasets, built models like LSTM and Transformer, and trained the models on multiple datasets in a federated learning way.

My specialties: 
+ Machine learning
+ Deep learning
+ Federated Learning
+ Statistics
+ Python
+ SQL
+ Research analysis
+ Algorithmic design and fairness
+ Privacy preserving

I like technology, tennis, traveling, politics, arts, eating my way around the world, and talking about the future of AI. So if you ever want to bounce ideas from me, please feel free to contact me.
